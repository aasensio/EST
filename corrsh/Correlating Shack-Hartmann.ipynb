    "Inferring the wavefront using a Shack-Hartmann when the reference object is extended is more difficult than in the case of point objects. With point objects, measuring the displacement of the star in each one of the subapertures directly gives the local slope of the wavefront. By putting all together, it is possible to infer the wavefront.\n",
    "When the object is extended, measuring the slope of the wavefront is usually done using correlating techniques. One of the subapertures is selected as a reference and the correlation function between each subaperture and the reference one is obtained. Several techniques can be applied to obtain subpixel precision in the measurement of the shift. It is usual to fit a paraboloid to the peak of the correlation function and infer the subpixel position of the peak. Other techniques work directly in the Fourier space, by utilizing the phase difference between each subaperture and the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To my knowledge, all correlating Shack-Hartmann work by computing the correlation between each subaperture and the reference one, and no restriction is put on the inferred slopes. In this work, we introduce the prior that the wavefront has to be given as an expansion in a set of orthogonal basis functions (Zernike or Karhunen-Loeve modes). This allows us to compute the modes of the wavefront directly from the measurement of the phases and use all subapertures together."
