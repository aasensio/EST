DST system:
aperture=0.76m
r0=10cm
65 KL modes corrected

layers:
heights= [0.0, 2000.0, 6000.0, 13000.0]  m
frac= [0.70, 0.20, 0.06, 0.04] %
wind= [6.0, 6.0, 5.6, 4.5] m/s

output: 300 images of 300x300 pixels
Each image is a short exposure with different random phase screens.
The AO system is allowed to correct the image for 100 iterations and a
snapshot is taken.
The phase screens have random r0 values ranging from 5 cm to 30 cm.


FOV = 10x10"
wavelength=500nm  (not the wavelength of the data, just used to scale PSF and such)
