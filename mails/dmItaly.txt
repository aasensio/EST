1. Have you used the same DM size for all inclination angles? And if that is the case, was it larger than 
the telescope's pupil? How did you handle the pupil's lengthening in one axis? Was the tilted pupil larger or smaller than the DM? 

2. If the system uses a WFS with 8 cm subapertures, why do you use only 11x11 actuators, equivalent to 40 cm pitch?

3. Concerning the simulation, the reference you give only give daytime profiles up to 5 km. Which are the specific
details of the atmosphere you used?

4. The projection of the pupil on an inclined mirror is elongated in the x axis, so that the actuators are more
separated than in normal incidence. However, you show that the actuators are less separated in the y direction.
Which is the explanation for this strange behavior?

5. It is not clear at all from the text that you used different interaction matrices or influence functions for different
angles (i.e. using calibration matrices measuring the response of each WFS slope to each DM actuator). 
We are convinced that, if you take into account that the DM is inclined during the calibration
phase, the DM can work irrespectively of the inclination (GTCAO mirror is inclined and some
studies were done about this issue also for EST back in 2010).

6. Why is tilt induced in the normal incidence case? We cannot think of any reason for
that and we don't really understand the reason you mention in the text.

7. Zenith angle 30 degrees and conjugation height 0 km seem to be somehow incoherent parameters. 
The pupil plane turbulence should not be affected by the zenith angle. Could you explain the reason for combining those figures?.

8. It could be nice to have more details about the simulation (i.e. number and nature of controlled modes, simulated latency, noise,...).

9. Up to what point have you taken into account that the atmospheric turbulence should also be expanded by the inclination of the mirror, in the same proportion than the actuator pitch?
